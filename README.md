# Automatic Clothing Classification from Photographs

This project focuses on developing an image classification system capable of identifying different types of clothing from photographs using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of clothing items across 10 categories (e.g., T-shirt, trousers, pullover, dress, etc.). The objective is to achieve high classification accuracy and demonstrate a scalable approach that could be extended to real-world clothing datasets.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment in artificial intelligence and computer vision.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Clear training/validation visualizations (loss and accuracy curves)
- Modular, readable code suitable for future expansion

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
